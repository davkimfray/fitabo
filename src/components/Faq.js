          <p>fitabo categorizes its users in two groups.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>1. Primary Users:</strong> Those who are looking for fitness
            sessions and they need a trainer who can help them reach their
            goals.
          </p>
          <h3>How does it work?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              fitabo trainers visit your home, workspace, or other creative
              spaces on your schedule.
            </li>
            <li>
              fitabo trainer will maximize the minimum time you have available
              to make a fitness session part of your schedule and goals.
            </li>
            <li>
              A fitabo trainer is a trainer who is well equipped with mats,
              props, and customized classes to make your session easy.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>2. Secondary Users: </strong>Those who are looking for
            individuals to train. If you are a fitness coach, personal trainer
            and you know that you can handle training others, fitabo gives you
            an opportunity to do so but with certification.
